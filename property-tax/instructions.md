# Instructions  

A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent of the propertyï¿½s actual value. If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then $0.75 for each $100 of the assessment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $45.00. Write a GUI program that displays the assessment value and property tax when a user enters the actual value of a property.
