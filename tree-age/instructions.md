# Instructions  

Counting the growth rings of a tree is a good way to tell the age of a tree. Each growth ring counts as one year. Use a Canvas widget to draw how the growth rings of a 5-year-old tree might look. Then, using the create_text method, number each growth ring starting from the center and working outward with the age in years associated with that ring.
